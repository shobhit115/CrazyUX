# CrazyUX – Crazy User Experience Neomorphic UI Website

## Overview
CrazyUX is a creative and experimental web project built to showcase funny, quirky, and unconventional UI/UX designs.  
The website uses an upside-down layout where the page loads from the **bottom**, and users scroll **upward** to explore the content.

It blends soft neumorphism, a white minimalist look, and subtle multi-color glow effects to create a playful and futuristic visual experience.

## Theme of the Website
The design follows a **white, ultra-clean, soft-neomorphic theme** with:

- Pure white base  
- Soft inner and outer shadows  
- Rounded edges and smooth curves  
- Subtle rainbow-tinted glow on hover  
- Minimalistic, low-contrast components  
- Soft, floating UI elements  

The overall feel is:
**Light, airy, futuristic, playful, and modern.**

## What Is CrazyUX?
CrazyUX is an event where participants design **funny, weird, and imaginative UI/UX layouts**.  
The purpose is not perfect design but **creativity, humor, and experimentation**.

CrazyUX encourages creators to:

- Break conventional UI/UX rules  
- Build unusual layouts  
- Add fun and humor to interfaces  
- Explore strange and unexpected interactions  
- Think differently and design freely  

The website reflects this by using an upside-down structure, soft neumorphism, and a playful visual tone.
